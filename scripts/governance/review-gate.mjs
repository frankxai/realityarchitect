/**
 * Review gate: every finding an AI reviewer (Codex, Copilot, Claude) leaves on a pull request must be answered by
 * the PR author or a repository member before it merges. A P2/P3 needs any such reply or a resolved thread. A P0/P1
 * needs a fix — a reply naming a commit of this PR made after the finding — or a reasoned "Declined: <why>".
 * Findings in review bodies or PR comments count when they carry a severity badge. Human threads are left to humans.
 *
 * Why: merges are autonomous, so the reviewer's findings are the quality gate. An unanswered finding means nobody
 * decided about it; on #817 a reviewer found three real defects that every automated check had passed.
